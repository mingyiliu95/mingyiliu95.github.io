I am currently a Computer Science Ph.D. student in the [School of Cybersecurityâ€¯and Privacy](https://scp.cc.gatech.edu/) at Georgia Tech. I am honored working with [Prof. Taesoo Kim](https://taesoo.kim/) at the [Systems Software & Security Lab (SSLab)](https://gts3.org/). Before pursuing a Ph.D., I received my Master's degree in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.gatech.edu/) from Georgia Tech and Bachelor's from [China University of Mining and Technology, Beijing](https://english.cumtb.edu.cn/).

My research interests lie in the general area of system and software security, automatic detection of vulnerabilities and bugs in the real world, as well as the security and reliability for interdisciplinary studies.
